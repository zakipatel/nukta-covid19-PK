## Background / Intro 

### Outbreak Analysis - an overview

Core Data: 
- Population
- Place
- Pathogen

Overlay Data: 
- Cases 
- Travel Patterns (humans as vectors) 

Outputs: 
- Get to Epi Curve + Spread value of R0. Model impact of interventions. 
- Visualize the outbreak over space and time -> a map with layers and annotations. 

Analysis: 
- Can we predict which districts / timing / severity of cases ? 
- Did social distancing / lockdown have an impact? 
- Correlation of cases to population, other indicators
