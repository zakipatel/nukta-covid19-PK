# Covid-19 in Pakistan

This repo contains data, analysis, visualization and links to resources.

## Things I have worked on 

### Covid in Punjab
- https://github.com/zakipatel/nukta-covid19-PK/blob/master/cases-punjab-district.md
- Here you will find case counts at the district level in Google Sheets,  a Tableau dashboard and other relevant stuff

### Covid in Sindh
- https://github.com/zakipatel/nukta-covid19-PK/blob/master/case-counts-sindh.md
- Here you will find case counts at the district level in Google Sheets and some charts


## Things I want to do

These are Very Interesting Resources

## Background / Intro 

### Outbreak Analysis - an overview

Core Data: 
- Population
- Place
- Pathogen

Overlay Data: 
- Cases 
- Travel Patterns (humans as vectors) 

Outputs: 
- Get to Epi Curve + Spread value of R0. Model impact of interventions. 
- Visualize the outbreak over space and time -> a map with layers and annotations. 

Analysis: 
- Can we predict which districts / timing / severity of cases ? 
- Did social distancing / lockdown have an impact? 
- Correlation of cases to population, other indicators
